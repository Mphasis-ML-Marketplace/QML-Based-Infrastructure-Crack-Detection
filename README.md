# QML-based-Infrastructure-Crack-Detection

## Product overview

This is a hybrid classical-quantum machine learning based solution which detects cracks on concrete and other civil infrastructure surface images. The algorithm uses a pre-trained DCGAN before variational quantum circuit. The DCGAN model is trained on in hand dataset to perform feature transformation. This trained DCGAN model enhances feature to be used as input in quantum architecture. The algorithm used in this solution inherits variational quantum circuit layers with trained parameters dedicated for surface crack image classification.

## Product Highlight 

* The appearance of cracks and distortions can be visually unattractive and disconcerting for occupants, and if left untreated they can affect the integrity, safety and stability of the structure. In case of railway bridge, flyover or foot bridge, it is crucial to regularly inspect the structures for cracks or any other defects. this solution can be used by agencies like Municipalities, review boards, construction comapanies to moniter the civil structure health and take corrective action when necessary.
* Quantum based Surface Crack Detection solution analyzes the images of concrete surfaces and predicts presence or absence of cracks. The current solution provides quantum ML based alternative to state of the art classifical deep learning based image classification systems.
